The privacy policy is very simple:
:br
# NO DATA IS KEPT. PERIOD. YOUR ARCHIVE BELONGS TO YOU AND YOU ALONE.
:br
# What little data we may have (number of users, etc) will not be sold or shared without explicit consent unless required by law.

**Yes!** Check the [source code](https://github.com/Ast3risk-ops/archiver/blog/main/main.py) if you're not convinced.
