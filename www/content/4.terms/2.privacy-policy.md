The privacy policy is very simple:
:br
# NO DATA IS KEPT. PERIOD. YOUR ARCHIVE BELONGS TO YOU AND YOU ALONE.
:br
# What little data we may have (number of users, etc) will not be sold or shared without explicit consent unless required by law.

Archiver downloads message attachments temporarily to re-upload them. These files are deleted from the server after being re-uploaded to Discord. This procedure is required to prevent archived files and images from expiring.

**Yes!** Check the [source code](https://github.com/Ast3risk-ops/archiver/blob/main/main.py) if you're not convinced.
