Welcome to our first changelog! ðŸŽ‰

This is an upgrade from the old alpha changelogs, which can be found [here](https://knockout.chat/thread/67393/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" }.

Here's what's changed (from the alpha):

## :icon{name="lucide:diamond-plus"} Features

- Initial feature set laid out on the [features page](/usage/features).
- New hero videos and landing page improvements.
- Attachments are downloaded and re-uploaded (then deleted from the server) instead of saving the URL. If the message itself is just a URL this will not happen.
- The bot now counts embeds and attachments.

## :icon{name="lucide:bug-off"} Fixes

- Proper interaction handling (no more hanging modals).
- Moved avatars to the CookieBot API (via `ezcord`) so they're persistent.
- Changed author display to record username (users who aren't in the same guild or friends can't be mentioned)
- Made the buttons persistent so they will work even after a restart.
- Made TOS proper (thanks `@hyenafr`).
