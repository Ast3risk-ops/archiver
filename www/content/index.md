:h2[FAQ]

::collapsible
#title
How do I use the app?

#content
See our [quickstart guide](/setup/quickstart) or run `/help`.

::collapsible
#title
Where can I see updates?

#content
They're posted in the support server and the original [Knockout thread](https://knockout.chat/thread/67393/).
::

::collapsible
#title
Why not use Forwards?

#content
Discord's builtin forwarding feature does allow you to store messages somewhere, but you won't get much information on them (only link and timestamp, not even author information). You also lose what little information is given if the message or server is deleted (since the link won't work). Forwards from DMs will have no link or timestamp. You also can't forward polls.

::collapsible
#title
Can I use this app in a guild?

#content
Yes! Just click **Add to Server**. It will be available to all your members if installed. We're hoping to add extra features for guild install in the future.
