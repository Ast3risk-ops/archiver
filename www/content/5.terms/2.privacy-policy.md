1. Archiver downloads message attachments temporarily to re-upload them. **These files are deleted from the server after being re-uploaded to Discord.** This procedure is required to prevent archived files and images from expiring.
If the upload fails for any reason, an error is shown to the user and the file is deleted.
2. Errors are reported to the developers via a webhook. This report includes:
    - The ID and username of the user who encountered the error.
    - The guild ID and name where the error was encountered, if applicable.
    - The command or UI button that was run.
    - The error log itself.

   The error is also logged to [`stdout`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)){ target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } with no supplemental information.

No other data is kept.
